## Including BibTex references

There are many ways to manage BibTex references. In [ReadCube Papers](https://www.papersapp.com/), you just right-click to select `Copy...>BibTex entry` and paste it into your BibTex file (I also have a script that formats your entire Papers library for BibTex with meaningful labels).

You can render citations in different ways to accommodate their sentence. Skov et al. reported strong selection on the human X chromosome [-@Skov2023]. Lineages in small populations have shorter coalescence times [see @NielsenSlatkin2016, chap. 1]. The Neanderthal genome has been sequenced [@Prufer2012]. The X chromosome is subject to recurrent sweeps [@Nam2015; @Dutheil2015]. Following @Munch2014, we blah blah...

## Illustrations

You can see an elephant in @fig-elephant. 

::: {#fig-elephant }

![](illustrations/elephant.png){width="50%"}

Some caption for an illustration showing an elephant
:::

Elephants are big (@fig-bigelephant):

:::{#fig-bigelephant .column-screen-inset-right}
![](illustrations/elephant.png)
:::

There are two elephants in @fig-twoelephants. The elephants in @fig-surus and @fig-hanno look similar.

::: {#fig-twoelephants layout-ncol=2}

![](illustrations/elephant.png){#fig-surus}

![](illustrations/elephant.png){#fig-hanno}

Some caption you wrote for an illustration of two elephants.

## Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference[^elephant] so you can read about elephants in the margin too.

[^elephant]: Elephants have long trunks and big ears if they are African. The one on the picture is Indian.


## Asides

If you like, [you can make comments in the margin without footnote a reference.]{.aside}


## Plot included from notebook

See plot @fig-danishinteraction below.

{{< embed ../notebooks/example.ipynb#fig-danishinteraction echo=false >}}

Or this really wide plot below (@fig-danishinteractionfacets).

:::{.column-screen}
{{< embed ../notebooks/example.ipynb#fig-danishinteractionfacets echo=false >}}
:::

## Text included from notebook

{{< embed ../notebooks/example.ipynb#doc-sampling echo=false >}}

## Table included from notebook

These were selected to represent as many nationalities as possible (@tbl-subjects). 

you can also allow the table to be wider

{{< embed ../notebooks/example.ipynb#tbl-subjects echo=false >}}



## Margin content

You can anything in the margin like @fig-meaninformality.

::: {.column-margin}
{{< embed ../notebooks/example.ipynb#fig-meaninformality echo=false >}}
:::


## Diagrams

Diagram in @fig-diag.

::: {#fig-diag width=10%}

```{dot}
//| label: fig-graphviz
//| fig-cap: "This is a simple graphviz graph."
graph G {
  layout=neato
  run -- intr;
  intr -- runbl;
  runbl -- run;
  run -- kernel;
  kernel -- zombie;
  kernel -- sleep;
  kernel -- runmem;
  sleep -- swap;
  swap -- runswap;
  runswap -- new;
  runswap -- runmem;
  new -- runmem;
  sleep -- runmem;
}
```

:::


```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Beginning] --> B[Middle]
  B --> C[End]
```


::: {.column-margin}

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Beginning] --> B[Middle]
  B --> C[End]
```

This is a flow chart.

## Code

Executed but hide code and any output:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

x = 5
```


Show and execute Python code:

```{python}

x = 5
```

Values can be embedded in the text, too. The value of `x` is `{python} x`.

Shown, not executed, Python code:

```python
y = 4
```

::: {.column-margin}
A for loop:

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
:::

Shown, not executed, R code:

```r
z <- 7
```

## Math

This is calculated as $\pi_k = \prod_{i=1}^K x_i$. You can crossref formulas (@eq-definition).

$$
\lambda = \sum_{k=1}^N \pi_k
$$ {#eq-definition}

::: {.column-margin}
We know from *the first fundamental theorem of calculus* that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$

**This is bold**, __so is this__. *This is italics*, _so is this_. __*This is both*__, **_so is this_**.
